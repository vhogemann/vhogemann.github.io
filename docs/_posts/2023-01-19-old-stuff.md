Old blog
==

Believe or not [Blogger](http://victorhogemann.blogspot.com/) still exists, and I actually wrote a bunch of stuff there.

Medium
==

I also have a [Medium](https://medium.com/@vhogemann) account, and wrote a couple of articles there.

There's one about [Using database functions in JPA Criteria projections](https://medium.com/@vhogemann/using-database-functions-in-jpa-criteria-projections-dacdbe99f56b).

And another about [Testing Native Queries with Functions in Spring Boot with JPA and H2](https://medium.com/@vhogemann/testing-native-queries-with-functions-in-spring-boot-with-jpa-and-h2-7d379dced0ff).
